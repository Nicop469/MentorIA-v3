# MentorIA

This project provides an adaptive learning platform built with React.

## Data Types

Courses are described by the `Course` interface found in `project/src/types`.
A course may optionally include structured `chapters` which are defined by the
`Chapter` type. Each chapter lists its concepts so that teachers can create
targeted practice sessions.
